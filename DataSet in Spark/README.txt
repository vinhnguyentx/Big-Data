For this assignment, input the file dataSet12.csv into a DataSet and compute the following using SQL:

By make/model, the min, max, and average price (excluding VINs with price = 0)
By year, the min, max, and average mileage (excluding VINs with mileage - 0)
By VIN, the total for each event type (you'll need to split out the event type from the event)
Note that the same VIN (and associated make, model, price, and mileage) appears multiple times in the events, so only consider each VIN once in the price and mileage statistics
