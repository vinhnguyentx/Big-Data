For assignment 10, re-implement the inverted index from Assignment 3, this time using Spark instead of Hadoop map-reduce.  The output file should be ordered by the words being indexed (lexicographical order), and the verse references should be ordered by book, chapter, and verse number. As we did in Assignment 3, remove punctuation and make all the words lower case.

The input files can be found on Canvas: Files / Assignment 10
