Goals:

Compile a Java map-reduce program
Create a JAR file containing the map-reduce code, ready for upload to AWS or Hadoop cluster
Login to your Hadoop cloud service (if not using a local install)
Create sub-folders in your account for jar files, logs, inputs, and outputs. I recommend "jars", "logs", "data", and "output".
Upload the JAR file
Define a cluster and job steps, and run the map-reduce job
Examine files generated by the map-reduce job execution
Download the output

How to Run:
- Compile: mvn clean package
- Run: hadoop <full path to the jar file> <input> <output>
